QuiContext
=====================
JS context menu library for modern browsers

Yet another useless library. Written for chrome extension, then decided to develop separately...
It's day will come, trust me. Eventually.

Features
---
 - Right-click element to get custom, GoogleChrome-looking context menu.
 - Menus assignable by custom element attribute
 
Future plans
---
 - Nested menus
 - Icons (and sprites)
 - Maybe support for IE8 or something
 - URLs
 - Check-functions (to decide if menu item has to be disabled or hidden for this very right-clicked element)
