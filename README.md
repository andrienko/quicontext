QuiContext
=====================
JS context menu library for modern browsers

Yet another useless library. Written for chrome extension, then decided to develop separately...
It's day will come, trust me.

Features
---
 - Right-click element to get custom, (windows) chrome-looking context menu.
 - Menus assignable by custom element attribute
 
Future plans
---
 - Nested menus
 - Icons (and sprites)
 - Support for major browsers. Maybe even IE8
 - URLs
 - Checker functions (to decide if menu item has to be disabled or hidden for this very right-clicked element)
